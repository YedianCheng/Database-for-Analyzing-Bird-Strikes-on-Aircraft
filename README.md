# Analysis of Wildlife Strikes to Aircraft

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing wildlife strikes on aircraft using data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The data is extracted and processed in R to generate insights about strike patterns, such as frequency by species, location, and environmental factors. The project helps identify key trends and potential preventive measures.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Loaded FAA wildlife strike data from CSV files into a structured format for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzed patterns in wildlife strikes including location, species involved, and weather conditions.
- **Strike Frequency Analysis**: Insights on which airports and species are most frequently involved in strikes.
- **Weather Impact Analysis**: Explored how different weather conditions affect wildlife strikes.
- **Reporting**: Generated a comprehensive report summarizing key findings from the analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **R**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For creating visualizations of the strike data.
- **RMarkdown**: For generating a structured report with insights from the analysis.
- **CSV**: The dataset is stored in CSV format and loaded into R for analysis.

## Project Structure

- `AnalysisofWildlifeStrikestoAircraft.Rmd`: This is the main RMarkdown file used for the analysis of the wildlife strike dataset.
- `docs/AnalysisofWildlifeStrikestoAircraft.pdf`: A report generated from the RMarkdown file, summarizing the key findings and visualizations from the analysis.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install necessary R packages (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`).
3. Open `AnalysisofWildlifeStrikestoAircraft.Rmd` in RStudio.
4. Run the code to generate insights and produce visualizations.
5. Knit the RMarkdown file to generate an HTML report.

## Analytical Queries

1. **Strike Frequency by Location**: Determines which airports experience the highest number of wildlife strikes.
2. **Species Involved in Strikes**: Analyzes the species of wildlife most frequently involved in strikes.
3. **Weather Conditions During Strikes**: Explores how weather conditions correlate with wildlife strike frequency.

## Reports

The detailed analysis report can be viewed [here](docs/AnalysisofWildlifeStrikestoAircraft.pdf).

## Future Improvements

- Extend the analysis to include more recent data from other sources.
- Develop predictive models to anticipate high-risk periods for wildlife strikes.
- Visualize strike patterns using interactive tools like Shiny.
